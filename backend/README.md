# Default Backend Environment Variable Setup
Create `.env` in the root of the BACKEND folder.

`Contact the project lead to acquire backend .env variables for testing.`

# Running the backend server
Only after you have setup the .env variables, run the following commands within the backend directory (These will not work if you are not in the correct directory)

### Change directories to backend if you're not already there
```
cd ./backend
```
This will execute the following commands in the backend directory.

### Install all npm dependencies
```
npm i
```
Do not attempt to update or fix any packages. This is a critical task and should not be done unless that is the feature being worked on.
### Run development server
```
npm run dev
```
This will run the server.
