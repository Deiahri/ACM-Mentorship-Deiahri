# Default Frontend Environment Variable Setup
Create `.env` in the root of the FRONTEND folder.

`Contact the project lead to acquire backend .env variables for testing.`


# Running the frontend server
Only after you have setup the .env variables, run the following commands within the backend directory (These will not work if you are not in the correct directory)

### Change directories to frontend (if you're not already there)
```
cd ./frontend
```
This will execute the following commands in the backend directory.

### Install all npm dependencies
```
npm i
```
Do not attempt to update or fix any packages. This is a critical task and should not be done unless that is the feature being worked on.


### Run development server
```
npm run dev
```
This will run development server.
